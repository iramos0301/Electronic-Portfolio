                    <h3>Judo (2022 - 2023)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Judo is a sport where people attempt to throw or pin each other get points to win. High school judo has team competitions and individual competitions.
                        Judo was the first sport and club that I joined out of a whim during high school. It was a memorable experience given that I had to balance 
                        going to practice everyday along with my academics and early college. Despite this, I still persevered and was able to practice
                        judo for 2 seasons during my freshman and sophomore year. During judo, we had to endure physically taxing workouts, spars with other
                        judokas, and the responsibility of going to every practice and competition. Through these experiences, I was able to learn how to 
                        cooperate and grow with my team members in a more competitive sense while being able to challenge myself to take on more responsibilities
                        besides school. Overall, judo was a great experience that taught me many life lessons like being consistent, building long lasting friendships
                        through rivalries, and having discipline.

                    <p>Math team is a club which the members compete in math competitions which are all under the Oahu Math League (OML). 
                       Math team was something I joined out of my interest for math and because I believed that I would do well since math is my strong suit, however,
                       Math team definitely humbled me. The math problems that we had to solve made me realize that there are more math skills that I can learn and I still
                       need to hone what I already know so that I become more accurate and quick at solving math problems. Nonetheless, I still enjoy the competitions because
                       it challenges me while also tests me on my favorite subject. Additionally, it's enjoyable getting to know other people that share the same interest in math 
                       as I do, sometimes people are even passionate about it.

                    <p>Phi Theta Kappa is a honor society that's at the collegiate level. PTK members are recognized for academic achievements
                       and strive for scholarship, laedership, felllowship, and service. PTK offers these traits through various activities and events
                       such as community service, PTK catalyst (an event that brings together members for professional development), scholarships offered by 
                       PTK, and encourages members to uphold their membership by participating in their community that presents these traits. Through PTK,
                       I started becoming more involved with my community. This is mainly because of the community service opportunities that were given 
                       to the members and required community service hours. In addition to becoming more involved in my community, I was able to grow as a person.
                       During some PTK events, there'd be professional speakers that helped to inspire and bring a new perspective on life that helped to encourage me to
                       grow further.

                    <p>E-sports is another club that I joined because it piqued my interests greatly. Ever since I was a child, 
                       I played video games a lot and always wanted to join a club that was about playing games. Being able to do that
                       in high school while also making the game we play competitive gives me something to look forward to. I get to 
                       play against people who are better than me so that I can improve my skills as well as socialize with people who also play
                       the same games that I do. Although there's the stigma that video games are unhealthy and causes grades to drop, e-sports is 
                       a great outlet for me to still be able to play games without getting so obsessed that my grades drop. If I want to be able to 
                       play games afterschool without having to be stresesd, I make sure to finish my work and my grades are all good. E-sports is an
                       enjoyable club that I love and helps to bring a sense of casuality to school.
